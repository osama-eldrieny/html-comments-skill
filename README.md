## Quick Start (Setup & Browser Usage)

This section covers installation and local testing. 
**For Claude Code integration, see [`WORKFLOWS.md`](./WORKFLOWS.md) and [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md)**

</br>

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osama-eldrieny/Pointer.git
```

</br>

### Step 2: Start the Comments Server (Terminal 1)

Navigate to the skill folder and start the server:

```bash
cd Pointer/comments-skill
npm install
npm start
```

**Or, run it as a single command:**
```bash
cd Pointer/comments-skill && npm install && npm start
```

You'll see:
```
🎯 HTML Comments server running at http://localhost:3001
📌 Bookmarklet page: http://localhost:3001/bookmarklet
```

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; border: 2px solid #ffc107; border-radius: 8px; padding: 12px 16px; margin: 16px 0;">
  <strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Keep this terminal open</strong> — the comments server must stay running for the bookmarklet to work.
</div>


</br>

### Step 3: Enable Comments with Bookmarklet (Quick Testing)

1. Open `http://localhost:3001/bookmarklet` in your browser
2. **Drag the "Pointer" logo to your bookmarks bar** (click and hold, then drag)
3. The pointer bookmark should now appear in your browser's bookmarks as "🐕 Pointer"
4. On any page, click the bookmarklet to activate the comments UI

</br>

### Step 4: Setup AI Agent Integration (One-Time Only)

Install the Pointer skill files to your project (this teaches your AI agent how to apply and merge comments):

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/pointer
curl -o .claude/skills/pointer/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osama-eldrieny/Pointer/main/SKILL.md
curl -o .claude/skills/pointer/WORKFLOWS.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osama-eldrieny/Pointer/main/WORKFLOWS.md
```

**What you just installed:**
- `SKILL.md` — Complete workflow guide (Apply & Merge workflows with examples)
- `WORKFLOWS.md` — Quick reference for which command to use

**Once installed, you can simply tell Claude Code:**
- `"apply pending comments"` — Claude will apply all queued changes to your HTML files
- `"merge comments"` — Claude will import team comments with automatic URL mapping

**Important:** When using Claude Code with Pointer, open it at your **project root** for full functionality.

</br>

### 🤖 Claude Code Integration Guide

Pointer has two main workflows with Claude Code:

#### ✨ Workflow 1: Apply Pending Comments
Apply changes from comments you've marked as "Pending Apply"
```
Tell Claude Code: "apply pending comments"
```
Claude will:
- Read pending changes from `pending-apply.json`
- Apply changes to your HTML files (CSS, HTML structure, content, etc.)
- Mark comments as "✓ Applied"
- Refresh your browser to see changes

#### ✨ Workflow 2: Merge Comments
Import comments from teammates (team collaboration feature)
```
Tell Claude Code: "merge comments"
```
Claude will:
- Find your ZIP file with team comments
- Ask you to map URLs (dev.company.com → localhost:5000)
- Merge comments into your project
- Save mappings for future imports

#### 📖 Complete Guides
- Quick start? → Read [`WORKFLOWS.md`](./WORKFLOWS.md)
- Detailed guide? → Read [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md)

**Important:** Open Claude Code at **project root**, not in comments-skill/ folder

</br>

### Step 5: Open Your Project in the Browser

**Open your Project HTML file in the browser** — either as a local server or directly:

- **Test file:** Open the included `test.html` file directly in your browser (file is at the project root)
- **Your project:** Open your own HTML file or project URL
- **Local server:** Open `http://localhost:8000`, `http://localhost:3000`, etc. (use whatever port your project runs on)
- **Static file:** Open `file:///path/to/your/project.html` (open HTML file directly without a server)


</br>


### Step 6: Start Commenting

This is how you add comments to any page (localhost, live URLs, static files):

1. **Click the "🐕 Pointer" bookmarklet** from your bookmarks bar
   - The Pointer toolbar appears in the **top-right corner**
   - The comments UI opens on the **right side**
2. Click **"+ Add Comment"** button in the toolbar
3. **Click any element on the page** you want to comment on
4. A popover appears with a text field
5. **Type your feedback** (be specific: "Make this text red", "Change font size to 16px", etc.)
6. **Submit your comment**
7. See a **numbered pin** appear on the element
8. Your comment is now saved to `pointer/comments-skill/comments.json`

**Works on:**
- ✅ Localhost pages (http://localhost:3000, etc.)
- ✅ Live URLs (https://www.yoursite.com)
- ✅ Static files (file:///path/to/page.html)
- ✅ Dev/staging servers (dev.company.com)

**Note:** If you refresh the page, you'll need to **click the bookmark again** to open Pointer. If you want Pointer to open automatically on every page load, check **Step 7 (One-Time Setup)** below to install it into your HTML.

</br>


### Step 7: One-Time Setup (Optional) - Auto-Load Pointer

Benefits of this optional one-time setup:
- ✅ Comments UI loads **automatically** on every page load
- ✅ No need to click the bookmarklet each time
- ✅ Comments persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Perfect for development workflows

To make Pointer always open and survive page refreshes, add one of these script tags to your HTML `<head>` or before `</body>`:

**Option 1: Add this code in `<head>` tag**
```html
<!-- HTML Comments Skill: Enables the comments UI on page load.
     Ensure the comments server is running on port 3001. -->
<script src="http://localhost:3001/inject.js" defer></script>
```

**Option 2: Or add this code**
```html
<script>
  (function() {
    var s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'http://localhost:3001/inject.js?t=' + Date.now();
    s.defer = true;
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>
```

**Note:** This is optional. Most users just click the bookmarklet when they want to add comments.

</br>


### Step 8: View & Manage Comments

1. Click the **expand icon** (≡) in the toolbar to open the comments sidebar
2. The sidebar opens showing all comments on the page
3. You can:
   - **Reply** to comments to discuss changes before applying
   - **Delete** comments you no longer need
   - **Read** full comment history with replies


</br>


### Step 9: Queue Changes for your AI Agent

When ready to apply a comment:

1. Click **"Ready to Apply"** button on the comment
2. The status changes to **"Pending Apply"** (highlighted in yellow)
3. If the comment has replies, you can mark individual replies instead
4. The comment is now in the queue for your AI to process

</br>



### Step 10: Apply Pending Comments

Once the skill file is set up (Step 4), simply tell Claude Code:

```
apply pending comments
```

Claude will:
- Read all queued comments from `pending-apply.json`
- Apply each change to the corresponding HTML file (CSS, HTML, content, etc.)
- Mark the comment/reply status as ✓ Applied

**Refresh your browser** to see the changes.
**That's it!** Your HTML is now updated with all the changes. 🎉

</br>
</br>

## Step 11: Add Comments on Live/Testing Servers

For Designers, QA, Product Managers, or anyone reviewing on live environments:

Works on **any page** — not just localhost!

- ✅ Production sites (`https://www.yoursite.com`)
- ✅ Testing servers (`https://testing.company.com`)
- ✅ Staging servers (`https://staging.company.com`)
- ✅ Development servers (`https://dev.company.com`)
- ✅ Static files (`file:///path/to/page.html`)

### How to add comments and send to developer:

1. **Run Pointer server** (Steps 1-3 — same as always)
2. **Open the live URL** in your browser
   - Could be testing, staging, development, or production
3. **Click the Pointer bookmark** (from your bookmarks bar)
   - The Pointer toolbar appears on top-right
   - Comments UI opens on right side
4. **Start adding comments** on the live page
   - Click any element to comment
   - Type feedback: "Make this red", "Fix spacing", etc.
   - Submit your comment
5. **Export comments** when done
   - Click the **export icon** (⬇️) in the toolbar
   - Download the ZIP file (contains all comments)
6. **Send the file to developer**
   - Share the ZIP file with front-end developer or team

</br>

## Step 12: Merge and Apply Comments (Developer Workflow)

For Front-end Developers applying team feedback in local code:

### How to merge and apply comments:

1. **Receive the ZIP file** from designer/QA

2. **Upload ZIP and tell Claude Code:** `merge comments`
   - In Claude Code, upload the ZIP file you got it from team mate and ask claude to "Merge Comments"
   - Claude will extract the ZIP and process the comments

3. **Answer URL mapping question** (if needed)
   - Claude asks: "testing.company.com maps to which local URL?"
   - You answer: "localhost:3000" or similar

4. **Claude merges the comments** into your local project
   - Claude processes the ZIP and merges all team comments
   - Refresh your browser to see your teammate's comments added to Pointer

5. **Apply comments** when ready
   - Tell Claude Code: `apply pending comments`
   - Claude edits your HTML files with the changes
   - Refresh to see changes live

### Key benefits:
- ✅ Comments stay private (no cloud upload)
- ✅ Works on any environment (live, staging, dev, etc.)
- ✅ Team can review without local setup
- ✅ Developer applies all changes at once with Claude
- ✅ Full conversation history preserved

</br>
</br>

## API Quick Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/comments?page_url=...` | Fetch comments for a page |
| POST | `/api/comments` | Create a comment |
| POST | `/api/comments/:id/reply` | Add reply to comment |
| PATCH | `/api/comments/:id` | Update status (for AI apply workflow) |
| DELETE | `/api/comments/:id` | Delete comment |


</br>
</br>

## Apply with Claude Code

Mark comments as **"pending-apply"** in the UI, then tell Claude Code:

```
Apply pending comments from pending-apply.json. Read the file,
apply each requested change to its HTML file, mark status as applied,
and clear pending-apply.json when done.
```

Claude will:
- Read `pending-apply.json` (auto-generated work queue)
- Edit HTML files on disk
- Mark comments/replies as ✓ applied in `comments.json`

See [CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md](comments-skill/CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md) for details.


</br>
</br>




## Configuration

Edit `comments-skill/config.json`:

```json
{
  "project_root": "../",            // Path to HTML files
  "server_port": 3001,              // Server port
  "url_base": "http://localhost:8000", // Your local server URL
  "comments_file": "./comments.json" // Where comments are stored
}
```


</br>
</br>

## Storage

- **comments.json** — All comments with full history (append-only)
- **pending-apply.json** — Work queue (auto-managed, cleared after applying)

Both are plain JSON — edit directly if needed.


</br>
</br>

</br>
</br>


## Workflow

1. **Add** — Click element, type feedback, submit
2. **Discuss** — Reply in context with team
3. **Mark** — Click "Mark Apply" when ready for AI
4. **Apply** — Tell Claude Code "apply pending comments"
5. **Done** — Changes live, status → ✓


</br>
</br>

## Why This Approach?

- **No database** — Plain JSON files, easy to version control
- **No auth** — Local team skill, no user management needed
- **No external API** — Claude Code applies changes locally
- **Portable** — Ship with your project, works anywhere
- **Transparent** — See exactly what's being applied


</br>
</br>

## Limitations

- Local/localhost only (not internet-facing)
- Single-process concurrency (file-based writes)
- No real-time sync across multiple users
- Node.js 14+ required



</br>
</br>

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3001
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :3001)

# Start fresh
npm start
```

**Bookmarklet not loading?**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify `config.json` url_base matches your server
- Ensure CORS is enabled (it is by default)

**Comments not showing?**
- Refresh page
- Check `comments-skill/comments.json` exists
- Verify paths in config are correct
