# Claude Code Integration Guide

This document explains how to use Claude Code to apply pending HTML comments automatically.

## The Flow

```
1. User marks comment as "Pending Apply" via bookmarklet UI
   ↓
2. Comment is automatically copied to pending-apply.json
   ↓
3. User opens Claude Code and says: "apply pending comments"
   ↓
4. Claude reads pending-apply.json (the work queue)
   ↓
5. Claude applies each change to the HTML files on disk
   ↓
6. Claude updates comments.json with AI reply and removes from pending-apply.json
   ↓
7. User refreshes browser, sees changes live + green ✓ badges
```

## 🔑 Key Design Principle

**`pending-apply.json` is the single source of truth — completely self-contained.**

When applying pending comments:
- ✅ Read ONLY `pending-apply.json` — it has everything you need
- ✅ Full conversation history is included in the `replies` array for context
- ✅ All metadata (selectors, snapshots, etc.) is present
- ❌ Do NOT need to check `comments.json` while applying
- ❌ Do NOT need to cross-reference multiple files

After applying:
- Update `comments.json` with the results (mark as applied, add AI reply)
- Server auto-removes from `pending-apply.json`

This design prevents confusion and ensures the AI always has complete context.

### Prompt Template

```
I'm using an HTML comments skill. Pending changes are in `comments-skill/pending-apply.json`.

**🔴 SACRED RULE: ALWAYS update the actual CSS rule that styles the element. NEVER create new element-specific selector rules.**

Why: The CSS rule identified in `applied_css_rules` is what's ACTUALLY styling the element. Update it directly.

The comment metadata includes element context:
- `element_selector`: CSS path to the element (e.g., `body > div > div:nth-of-type(2) > p`)
- `element_snapshot`: HTML of that element (e.g., `<p class="section-label">Auth Types</p>`)
- `element_classes`: CSS classes on it
- `parent_element_info`: Parent tag, classes, id (e.g., parent is `<div class="field-box">`)
- `computed_styles`: Current styles on the element
- `applied_css_rules`: **IMPORTANT** - Which CSS rules are ACTUALLY applying to this element
- `apply_to`: "element-only" = update rule for this element | "all-similar" = update rule for all with class

**WORKFLOW: Element + Comment → Understand → Update**

For each comment:
1. **Combine two inputs:**
   - Element metadata (selector, classes, parent, `applied_css_rules`)
   - Change request (comment `text` + `apply_to` field)

2. **Understand what's being asked:**
   - Analyze element: which CSS rule is ACTUALLY styling it? (from `applied_css_rules`)
   - Analyze request: what CSS property needs to change? (from `text`)

3. **Update the correct rule and save**

**If apply_to is "element-only":**

1. **Find the ACTUAL CSS rule** from `applied_css_rules`:
   - Don't assume from element's classes alone
   - Example: Element `<p class="section-label">` may appear to be styled by `.section-label` rule
   - But `applied_css_rules` shows `.field-box p { margin: 0; }` is what's actually applied (higher specificity)
   
2. **Interpret the change** from comment text:
   - "add 6px margin bottom" → change margin property to 6px
   - "change color to blue" → change color property
   - "increase font size" → increase font-size value

3. **🔴 CRITICAL: ALWAYS UPDATE THE ACTUAL CSS RULE - NEVER create element-specific selector rules:**
   - Find the existing CSS rule from `applied_css_rules`
   - Update THAT rule, nothing else
   - Find: `.field-box p { margin: 0 0 18px 0; }`
   - Change to: `.field-box p { margin: 0 }`
   - Save the HTML file
   
   **❌ WRONG:** Create `body > div > div > div:nth-of-type(3) > p { margin: 0 }`
   **✅ CORRECT:** Update `.field-box p { margin: 0 }`

4. **Parent context naturally limits scope:**
   - `.field-box p` already targets only `<p>` inside `.field-box`
   - Multiple elements sharing that rule get consistent changes
   - That's CORRECT behavior

**If apply_to is "all-similar":**
- User selected a pure CSS class
- Modify the global class rule
- This affects all elements with that class

**CRITICAL EXAMPLE:**

**Element**: `<p class="section-label">Auth Types</p>` in `<div class="field-box">`

**Current CSS:**
```css
.section-label { font-size: 11px; margin: 0 0 18px 0; }
.field-box p { margin: 0; }  /* ← This is what actually applies! */
```

**Comment**: "add 6px margin bottom"

**WRONG approach:** Modify `.section-label` rule
- Result: `.section-label { margin: 0 0 24px 0; }`
- Problem: The `.field-box p` rule overrides it, so change doesn't apply!

**CORRECT approach:** Modify the actual rule that applies
- Find: `.field-box p { margin: 0; }`
- Update to: `.field-box p { margin: 0 0 6px 0; }`
- Result: The element now has 6px margin-bottom as expected!

**Steps:**

1. Read `comments-skill/pending-apply.json`
2. **For each comment, follow this workflow:**

   **STEP A: Extract Element Information**
   - `element_selector` - the specific path to this element
   - `element_snapshot` - exact HTML of this element
   - `element_classes` - CSS classes on this element
   - `parent_element_info` - parent element's tag, classes, id
   - `applied_css_rules` - **which CSS rules are currently styling this element** (CRITICAL)
   
   **STEP B: Extract Change Request**
   - `text` - what does user want to change?
   - `apply_to` - "element-only" or "all-similar"?
   
   **STEP C: Analyze the Element**
   - Study `applied_css_rules` array to find which rule is ACTUALLY responsible for current styling
   - This is the most important step!
   - Example: Element may have class `.section-label` BUT be styled by `.field-box p` rule instead
   - The `applied_css_rules` array shows you which rule wins (has highest specificity)
   
   **STEP D: Interpret the Change**
   - Read comment text and understand what CSS property needs to change
   - Example: "add 6px margin bottom" → add margin-bottom property
   - Example: "change color to red" → update color property
   - Example: "make it bold" → set font-weight
   
   **STEP E: Update the Correct Rule**
   - Find the CSS rule from STEP C in the `<style>` tag
   - Modify THAT rule to apply the change
   - Save the HTML file
   
   **STEP F: Update Comment in comments.json**
   - Add AI reply explaining which rule was modified and what changed
   - Set status to "applied"
   
3. Remove from `pending-apply.json`
4. **Report the change**: "Updated `.field-box p` rule: changed margin from `0` to `0 0 6px 0`"
```

## Example: Applying a Real Comment

### Scenario: User clicks "Auth Types" label in connector card's Identity section

The element is: `<p class="section-label">Auth Types</p>` inside `<div class="field-box">`

### Step 1: User marks comment for apply

The comment in `pending-apply.json` includes:

```json
{
  "id": "c_1781540135907_n6ys5p",
  "element_selector": "body > div > div > div > div > div:nth-of-type(2) > div > div:nth-of-type(3) > p",
  "element_snapshot": "<p class=\"section-label\">Auth Types</p>",
  "element_classes": ["section-label"],
  "parent_element_info": {
    "tag": "div",
    "classes": ["field-box"],
    "id": null
  },
  "computed_styles": {
    "margin": "0px 0px 0px 0px",
    "font-size": "11px"
  },
  "applied_css_rules": [
    {
      "selector": ".section-label",
      "styles": "font-size: 11px; margin: 0 0 18px 0;"
    },
    {
      "selector": ".field-box p",
      "styles": "margin: 0;"
    }
  ],
  "text": "add extra 6px margin bottom",
  "apply_to": "element-only"
}
```

### Step 2: Claude Code reads and applies

Claude:
1. Reads `../Integration_Cards_Complete1.html`
2. Sees `apply_to: "element-only"` → apply to this specific element only
3. **Reads `applied_css_rules`** → TWO rules apply:
   - `.section-label { margin: 0 0 18px 0; }`
   - `.field-box p { margin: 0; }` ← **This one wins!** (more specific)
4. Reads `parent_element_info` → element is inside `.field-box`
5. Identifies that `.field-box p` is the actual rule styling the element
6. Interprets comment: "add 6px margin bottom" 
7. **Updates the actual rule**:
   ```css
   .field-box p { margin: 0 0 6px 0; }
   ```
   - This is the rule that actually applies to the element
   - Other `.field-box p` elements get this change too (they're similar in context)
   - Elements outside `.field-box` are not affected
8. Saves the HTML file
9. Adds reply showing which rule was updated
10. Sets status to "applied"

### Step 3: Result in comments.json

```json
{
  "id": "c_1781540135907_n6ys5p",
  "element_snapshot": "<p class=\"section-label\">Auth Types</p>",
  "text": "add extra 6px margin bottom",
  "status": "applied",
  "apply_to": "element-only",
  "replies": [
    {
      "id": "r_1781540135_ai",
      "author": "AI",
      "text": "Applied ✓ — Updated CSS rule `.field-box p` from `margin: 0` to `margin: 0 0 6px 0`. This is the actual rule styling your element. Result: Auth Types label now has 6px margin-bottom. Similar elements in .field-box context also updated.",
      "created_at": "2026-06-16T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**The Difference:**
- ❌ Wrong: Create specific element rule → doesn't help because parent rule overrides it
- ✅ Correct: Find and update the actual rule that applies → change takes effect immediately

### Step 4: User sees the result

1. User refreshes browser on `http://localhost:8080/index.html`
2. Clicks the bookmarklet
3. Sidebar shows the comment with:
   - Green ✓ "Applied" badge
   - AI reply showing what changed
4. HTML page now has the new font and size
5. User can export the updated HTML

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### When Element Selector is Stale

If the HTML has changed and the selector no longer works:

1. Claude tries the selector first: `document.querySelector(selector)`
2. If not found, Claude searches for the element by snapshot: `outerHTML === element_snapshot`
3. If still not found, Claude searches by text content
4. If none work: the comment stays visible in sidebar but won't apply

You can edit the comment or delete it and re-add it on the current element.

### Multiple Pending Comments on Same Element

Example:
- Comment 1: "Make this text bold"
- Comment 2: "Change color to blue"

Claude reads them in order and applies both to the same element sequentially.

### Comments Requesting Conflicting Changes

Example:
- Comment 1: "Make font size 16px"
- Comment 2: "Make font size 20px"

Claude should apply the last one (or ask for clarification in the AI reply). Typically the last marked-for-apply takes precedence.

---

## Claude Code Workflow in Detail

### 1. Read pending-apply.json
```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const fs = require('fs');
const pending = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./comments-skill/pending-apply.json', 'utf8'));
// That's it! All items in this file are ready to process
```

### 2. Group by HTML file (optional, for efficiency)
```javascript
const byFile = {};
pending.forEach(c => {
  if (!byFile[c.html_file_path]) byFile[c.html_file_path] = [];
  byFile[c.html_file_path].push(c);
});
```

### 3. Apply to each file
```javascript
Object.entries(byFile).forEach(([filePath, commentsForFile]) => {
  let html = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  
  commentsForFile.forEach(comment => {
    // Get the element's CSS classes
    const elementClasses = comment.element_classes || [];
    
    // Parse HTML to modify CSS rules
    const DOM = new JSDOM(html);
    const doc = DOM.window.document;
    
    // Find and modify the <style> tag
    const styleTag = doc.querySelector('style');
    if (styleTag && elementClasses.length > 0) {
      let cssText = styleTag.textContent;
      
      // For each CSS class the element has, find and modify the rule
      elementClasses.forEach(className => {
        const classSelector = `.${className}`;
        // This is simplified - you'll need more robust CSS parsing for complex rules
        // Look for the rule and update it based on comment.text
        // Example: if comment says "add margin-bottom: 40px"
        // Find the rule: `.section-label { ... }` and add the style
        cssText = updateCSSRule(cssText, classSelector, comment.text);
      });
      
      styleTag.textContent = cssText;
      html = DOM.serialize();
    }
    
    // Update comment status
    comment.status = 'applied';
    comment.replies.push({
      id: `r_${Date.now()}_ai`,
      author: 'AI',
      text: `Applied ✓ — ${summary of what CSS was modified}`,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  });
  
  // Write updated HTML
  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, html, 'utf8');
});

// 4. Update comments.json with AI replies and remove from pending-apply.json
const allComments = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./comments-skill/comments.json', 'utf8'));
pending.forEach(appliedComment => {
  const commentInFile = allComments.find(c => c.id === appliedComment.id);
  if (commentInFile) {
    commentInFile.replies.push({
      id: `r_${Date.now()}_ai`,
      author: 'AI',
      text: `Applied ✓ — ${summary}`,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    commentInFile.status = 'applied';
  }
});
fs.writeFileSync('./comments-skill/comments.json', JSON.stringify(allComments, null, 2), 'utf8');
fs.writeFileSync('./comments-skill/pending-apply.json', '[]', 'utf8'); // Clear the queue
```

### 4. Efficiency Notes

Since `pending-apply.json` only contains items to process, you don't need to filter. Just read, process, and clear. Much simpler!

## Natural Language Interpretation

Claude needs to interpret plain English comments into actual HTML changes:

| Comment | Interpretation |
|---------|---|
| "Change font to Inter" | `style="font-family: 'Inter, sans-serif'"` |
| "Make it larger" | increase `font-size` by ~20% or from implicit to explicit |
| "Make the button red" | `style="background-color: red"` or `class="btn-red"` |
| "Fix typo: 'Welcom' → 'Welcome'" | find and replace text content |
| "Center this text" | `style="text-align: center"` |
| "Remove this element" | delete the entire tag |
| "Add padding" | `style="padding: 20px"` (or increase existing) |

Claude is good at this kind of interpretation, but for best results, comments should be:
- **Specific**: "Change color to #007bff" (better than "make it blue")
- **Contextual**: "Change the hero heading font to Inter" (better than "Change font")
- **Actionable**: "Increase button padding from 10px to 15px" (better than "Make button bigger")

## Testing Your Integration

### Test 1: Simple Text Change

1. Create a test comment: "Change the word 'Welcome' to 'Hello'"
2. Mark it as pending-apply
3. Tell Claude: "apply pending comments"
4. Claude should find the element and replace "Welcome" with "Hello"
5. Refresh browser → see change live

### Test 2: Style Change

1. Create a test comment: "Change the header background color to #f0f0f0"
2. Mark it as pending-apply
3. Tell Claude: "apply pending comments"
4. Claude should add or modify the `style` attribute to include `background-color: #f0f0f0`
5. Refresh browser → see change live

### Test 3: Multiple Comments

1. Add three different comments on different elements
2. Mark all as pending-apply
3. Tell Claude: "apply pending comments"
4. Claude should apply all three and show three AI replies

---

## Tips for Success

### Do:
- ✅ Be specific about what to change
- ✅ Reference the element clearly (e.g., "the hero title" not just "text")
- ✅ Tell Claude exactly what you want ("Change X to Y")
- ✅ Let Claude ask questions if it's unclear

### Don't:
- ❌ Assume Claude knows which element you mean if there are multiple similar ones
- ❌ Use vague terms ("make it better", "fix it")
- ❌ Ask for complex refactoring in a comment (use chat for that)

### If Claude Gets Stuck:
- Clarify the element in a reply on the comment
- Delete and re-comment with more specific wording
- Use Claude Code chat to discuss the change first, then mark for apply

## FAQ

**Q: Can Claude apply comments to multiple HTML files?**
A: Yes! Each comment has `html_file_path`. Claude will read/edit multiple files as needed.

**Q: What if the HTML file doesn't exist?**
A: Claude should report an error. Check that `html_file_path` is correct relative to the project root.

**Q: Can I undo an applied comment?**
A: Technically, but there's no automatic undo. You'd need to:
1. Change comment status back to "pending-apply"
2. Have Claude revert the change
Or manually edit the HTML back.

Better practice: use a new comment if you need a different change.

**Q: Do comments persist after applying?**
A: Yes! Comments stay in `comments.json` with status "applied" and the AI reply. This creates a history of all changes made.

**Q: Can multiple people apply comments?**
A: Each time someone tells Claude to apply, it reads the current state of `comments.json`. As long as you're taking turns or working on different files, it should be fine. For concurrent work, coordinate who's applying when.
